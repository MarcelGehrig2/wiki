* SAP    Service Access Point


* HDLC	transports PDU from sender to receiver (HDLC contains sender/receiver address)
* PDU	Ptrotocoll Data Units
* DLSM
* OBIS	code 1.8.0 equeals load counter

* LD = Logic Device
 - address = 1 		-> management device
 - address > 1		-> other logical devices (gas, energy ...)
 - contains COSEM objects
   - COSEM objects contain attributes and methodes
   - first attribute is Logical Name (OBIS code)
* SN = short name (16-bit)
* LN = Logical name (OBIS-code)
* Each logical device contains at least one object of class:
 - Association-Object LN (OBIS) or Association-Object SN (16-bit identifier).
   - attribute 2 = 0.0.40.0.0.255. = object list
   - base name (VaaName) = ''FA00''
* HDLC layer
 - negotiating and builds a logical connection
 - segments long data into i-Frames
 -  verifies frames using CRCs
 - monitor timeouts
 - HDLC-address = MAC address
   { address of the logical device,
     address of the physical device} 	// can sometimes be ommited in point-to-point connection
 - client address 16 = public client
  - 1 byte		only logical address
  - 2 bytes		1 byte logical, 1 byte physical
  - 4 bytes		2 byte logical, 2 byte physical
* Frames.
 - I-frame (user data)	transport user data from the network layer. In addition they can also include flow and error control information piggybacked on data.
 - S-frame (control)	are used for flow and error control whenever piggybacking is impossible or inappropriate
 - U-frame 				are used for various miscellaneous purposes, including link management
* APDUs  (Application protocol data units) are the DLMS/COSEM messages that are sent from client to the meter and vice-versa
* Application layer
 - uses ASN.1 notation or XML notation
 - ReadRequest element
 - PDU (protocol data unit) encoding for byte sequence
 - AssociationRequest		establishes the connection
 - LN = logical name reference; referenced by the logical name (OBIS code).
  - Get/Set
 - SN = short name reference; 16 bit integer
  - Read/Write
 - The Proposed Dlms Version Number = 6
* Negotiation
 - <AssociationRequest> proposal from client
   - ApplicationContexName Value		SN / LN
   - ProposedConformance				Write / Read / Set / Get
   - ProposedMaxPduSize					FFFF 	client has no limit for PDU size
 - <AssociationResponse> accepted capabilities
* Scaler unit
 - first element: power of 10 (signed int)		i.e. "FF" = -1
 - second element: measureing unit				i.e. "1E" = Wh	(according to the Blue Book table 4 p.47)

* HDLC part
 - send  	SNRM 	93	Set normal response mode
 - get 		UA 		73
* DLMS/COSEM Part
 - send		AARQ	10	Application Association Request 
 - get		AARE	30	Application Association Response

* COSEM Objects
 - different classes of objects (interface classes (IC)) 
   - 1		Data
   - 3 		Register
   - 7		Profile generic
   - full list in Blue Book or confluence.noser

 * [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 255]		clock
 * [0.0.40.0.0.255]			object list (visible COSEM objects)
 * [0.0.41.0.0.255]			list of logical devices and SAP addresses
